TESTS

* UNIT (JUnit Mockito)
* INSTRUMENTATION (JUnit Mockito)
* UI (Expresso)

    --- UNIT ----

        Local Computer -> works on your local computer
        Java Virtual Machine -> work on JVM
        Very fast
        JUnit5, Mockito

    --- INSTRUMENTATION ----

        Similar to local unit test
        Need a real device or emulator
        JUnit4, Mockito

    ---- UI TESTING ----

        Simulate a person using your app
        Literally uses widgets
        Real device or emulator
        Expresso


    For android View
    * Src
      * androidTest ( Instrumentation & UI )
        Mockito,JUnit,Expresso
      * test ( Unit )
        Mockito,JUnit

** Shared directories for unit and instrumentation test.
   Create test-common directory and create the same named packages for creating
   shared data between unit and instrumentation test packages


   -- @Before JUnit4 ( @BeforeEach JUnit5 ) --
    Methods annotated with the @Before annotation are executed before each test.
    This is useful when we want to execute some common code before running a test.
    It is name as BeforeEach in JUnit5, in JUnit4 it is called Before

    -- @BeforeClass JUnit4 ( @BeforeAll JUnit5 ) --
    When we want to execute an expensive common operation before each test,
    it's preferable to execute it only once before running all tests using @BeforeClass.
    Some examples of common expensive operations are the creation of a database connection
    or the startup of a server.

    You have to use blockingGet when you are using single, when you are using
    flowable you have to use blockingFirst.
